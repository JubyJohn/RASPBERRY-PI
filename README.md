<br> Hi everyone this week I familiarized myself with the Raspberry pi module and I like to share my experience with you all..
<br> Firstly, Am introduced to Raspberry Pi module and its architecture. Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. It is a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer that can be plugged into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.

<br> We used Raspbian OS. Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. It offers a user-friendly experience and comes with a variety of pre-installed software, including programming tools, productivity software, and games. Raspbian provides a smooth and efficient interface for users to interact with their Raspberry Pi devices, making it a popular choice for hobbyists and educational purposes.

<br> We have done UDP communication with Raspberry Pi. UDP, which stands for User Datagram Protocol, is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It is a simple, connectionless protocol that operates on the transport layer and is often used in situations where speed and efficiency are more important than reliability. UDP is commonly used for streaming media, online games, voice over IP (VoIP), and other applications where real-time data transfer is critical. Unlike TCP, UDP does not provide error checking, flow control, or reliable data delivery, making it faster but less reliable for certain types of communication.

<br> And also familiarized myself with commands that used for server hosting, website hosting, and so on
<br> Some commonly used commands in Raspbian include:


![lcd-sudo-su](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1662860-7783-4cc4-9914-a016b64a0cb9)

1. ls - List directory contents
2. cd - Change directory
3. sudo - Execute a command as a superuser
4. nano - A text editor for the command line
5. apt-get - Package handling utility for Debian-based systems
6. mkdir - Create a new directory
7. rmdir - To remove directories
8. rm - Remove files or directories
9. ifconfig - Display network interface configuration
10. reboot - Restart the system
11. shutdown - Shut down the system
12. cat > filename - File created
13. cat filename - File opens
14. cat F1 F2 > F3 - To merge F1 and F2 files, then paste to F3 file
15. nano filename.c - To create c program file
16. gcc filename.c -o exe - To compile c program file
17. sudo ./exe - To run c program file
